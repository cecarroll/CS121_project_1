A French guy saying *not necessarily*

**An Earthquake Shakes the Scene**

The French guy exclaims ***Oh non!***

The list of things he lost in the fire: ---  

- his baguette due to being too crispy
- his cigarette, because the house smoked them all
- his pet French bulldog, because it thought the fire was a barbecue and wanted a bite

My name is Cole Carroll, and I am a Master's student at Ball State Unversity.

I am hoping to learn about all things computer science from the point of view of computer science, instead of from the point of view of vibe coding. I am also taking classes on o notation, so the speed of algorithms might be of particular interest. But above all, I am interested in (as the leadership professors would explain it in MBA 601) "developing self-efficacy through skill development and confidence in the skill."
I am thinking hard on this, but I think the most interesting thing about me is that I have big, laborious, requisite-of-lots-or-large-steps dreams, and itty bitty legs on which to leap and bound to them. And that I'm very much looking forward to re-shaping myself with the duration of the semester.
